The Spearhead Programming Language is a python-based code interpreter that is meant to be able to do high-level functions and low-level functions.
WINDOWS ONLY.
Spearhead is in a work in progress as of now, and has practically none of any of these features yet.
Spearhead is designed to have many complex math formulas have simple functions and ways of executing them.
Spearhead will also natively have functions to access many API's that normally need to be imported.
To run the Spearhead programming language, please run Terminal.py inside of the Spearhead folder.
